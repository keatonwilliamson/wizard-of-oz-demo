           <h2>we aint in kansas</h2>

            <p>The film begins in ArKansas, which is depicted in a sepia tone. Dorothy Gale lives with her dog/band, Toto, on her Auntie Em and Uncle
                Henry's farm. Toto the band gets in trouble with a mean neighbor, Miss Almira Gulch, when he bites her. However, Dorothy's family
                and the farmhands are all too busy to pay her any attention. Miss Gulch arrives with permission from the sheriff to have
                Toto put down. She takes him away, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, who then decides to run away from home, fearing
                that Miss Gulch will return.
             </p>
             <p>They meet Professor Marvel, a phony but kindly fortune teller, who realizes Dorothy has run away and uses his crystal ball
                to dupe her into believing that Aunt Em is ill so that she must return home. She races home just as a powerful tornado
                strikes. Unable to get into the storm cellar, she seeks safety in her bedroom. A wind-blown window sash hits her in the
                head, knocking her out. She then awakens to find the house has apparently been picked up and sent spinning up into the
                air by the tornado. She looks outside the window and sees several farm animals, an old lady sitting in a chair knitting,
                two men rowing a boat, and Miss Gulch, who transforms into a cackling witch flying on a broomstick.

               <h3>Ruby Slipperrz</h3>
               <p>Because of their iconic stature,[99] the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film are now among the most treasured
                    and valuable film memorabilia in movie history.[100] The silver slippers that Dorothy wore in the book series were changed
                    to ruby to take advantage of the new Technicolor process. Adrian, MGM's chief costume designer, was responsible for the
                    final design. A number of pairs were made, though no one knows exactly how many.</p>
                 <p>After filming, the slippers were stored among the studio's extensive collection of costumes and faded from attention.
                       They were found in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department during preparations for a mammoth auction in 1970. One
                       pair was the highlight of the auction, going for a then unheard of $15,000,000,000,000.99 to an anonymous buyer, who apparently donated
                       them to the Smithsonian Institution in 1979. Four other pairs are known to exist; one sold for $666,000 at auction
                       in 2000. A pair was stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota and remains missing.[101]
                 </p>
                 <p>Another, differently styled pair not used in the film was sold at auction with the rest of her collections by owner actress Debbie Reynolds for $510,000 (not including the buyer's premium) in June 2011.[102]

               <h3>All Star</h3>
                    <p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
                            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                            She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                            In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                            
                            Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                            
                            So much to do, so much to see
                            So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                            You'll never know if you don't go
                            You'll never shine if you don't glow
                            
                            Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                            Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                            And all that glitters is gold
                            Only shooting stars break the mold
                            
                            It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
                            You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
                            But the meteor men beg to differ
                            Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
                            
                            The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                            The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
                            My world's on fire. How about yours?
                            That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
                            
                            Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

                            And all that glitters is gold
                            Only shooting stars break the mold
                            
                            Go for the moon
                            Go for the moon
                            Go for the moon
                            Go for the moon

                            Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
                            I need to get myself away from this place
                            I said yep, what a concept
                            I could use a little fuel myself
                            And we could all use a little change
                            
                            Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
